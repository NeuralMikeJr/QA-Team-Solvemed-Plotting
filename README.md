# Introduction
Plotting is used to explore data, and is one of the most important tasks that engineers and scientists use computers for. 
Plots are used to:

- present and understand data; and
- to check computed results visually.

We will use the tools presented in this notebook to visualise results in subsequent files.

# Objectives
- Introduction to a programmatic approach to plotting 
- Create line plots and bar charts from discrete data sets
- Create line plots of mathematical functions
- Create histograms for distribution-like data 
- Develop interactive plots
- Create contour plots of functions of two variables
